# Project 2 - *Wordle*

Submitted by: ** Maria Perez **

**Wordle** is an app that uses a random secret word and the user has to guess
and the user gets hints by the changing of the color of the letter if it is correct, 
close, or incorrect. The user can add and delete letters. Now the user can also adjust the number of rows and letters and also change the theme of the secret word and an option to change the secret word after each completed line.

Time spent: **3.50** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [X] User can change the number of letters per row (the length of the goal word)
- [X] User can change the numbers of rows on the board (how many guesses allowed)
- [X] User can select a new themed set to pull the goal word from
- [X] User can select "alien wordle", causing the goal word to change after each guess


The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [ ] App displays a reset button on the top left to reset the game (but make no changes to the settings)

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

    Some of the challenges were learning the correct noatations and learning about the dictionary and just understading how the whole project works together in general.
